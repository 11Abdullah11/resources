# *Zowe Desktop Documentation Viewer*

## Description
Plugins may have a variety of documentation that are shipped with them: readmes, licenses, guides, api documentation and more. As the various types of documentation generally resides in file formats that browsers can visualize, be it PDF or text or markdown, it would be convenient to present this documentation in the same place where the plugins run. A standard viewer & standard packaging scheme is needed so that plugin developers do not instead come up with their own way to solve the same problem, multiple times.

## Additional Information
*This internship position will offer the candidate the possibility to be virtually embedded within the Zowe Web UI squad, with full access to the team via Slack, email, webex, and participation in all agile ceremonies. The candidate will be trained by the team on how to navigate the code base, install and run the Zowe App Framework, create and submit pull requests*

## Desirable Skills
*	Knowledge of JavaScript and/or TypeScript*
*	Understanding of transpiling and webpacking*
*	Experience with HTML web page creation*
*	Experience with SPA development using Angular or React*
*	Working knowledge of markdown text format*

## Expected Outcome
*Upon successful completion of the project, a new default web application will enable users to view text & pdf documents bundled into plugins. This viewer can be invoked via the Desktopâ€™s App2App communication scheme so that it can be popped up on-demand by the plugin, or opened directly by the user for them to be able to drill-down to each plugin & each documentation file.*
