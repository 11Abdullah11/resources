# *Kube CF  - Endgame Platform on Z*

## Description
*Following up on the previous projects that helped build the Cloud Foundry components and the CF Operator on Z.  The Kube CF project will be incubated in the Cloud Foundry Foundation in 2020, and there are release integration efforts happening, that will allow us to plugin tests and builds specifically for s390x.*

## Additional Information
*This effort will benefit the Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes communities, and the student will interact with engineers from SUSE, IBM and SAP.
