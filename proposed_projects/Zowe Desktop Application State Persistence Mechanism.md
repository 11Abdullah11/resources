# *Zowe Desktop Application State Persistence Mechanism*

## Description
*Web plugins running within the application framework do not have access to a secure state persistence mechanism that would allow a user to restore one of more plugins to an early state when restarting a session. The App Framework needs to provide this capability.*

## Additional Information
*This internship position will offer the candidate the possibility to be virtually embedded within the Zowe Web UI squad, with full access to the team via Slack, email, webex, and participation in all agile ceremonies. The candidate will be trained by the team on how to navigate the code base, install and run the Zowe App Framework, create and submit pull requests*

## Desirable Skills
*	Knowledge of JavaScript and/or TypeScript*
*	Understanding of transpiling and webpacking*
*	Experience with HTML web page creation*
*	Experience with SPA development using Angular or React*

## Expected Outcome
*Upon successful completion of the project, Zowe application developers will have access to a set of REST APIs and guidelines to enable their applications to respond to a session termination event and persist their states. Upon startup of a new session, a resuming application will have access to another set of APIs to retrieve their last known state and reconfigure themselves to enable a user to continue from the point they left off.*

## Difficulty
*Medium*
