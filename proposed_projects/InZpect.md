# *InZpect*

## Description
*InZpect is next generation dump viewer and inspector that is something of a successor to IPCS.  There is a lot of work to do in UI and testing.  Plus almost any work on the internals requires lots of knowledge of the operating system.  SVCDumps are not highly structured, so the relationships of data and state of the computation must be synthesized from the memory blocks in the dump, primarily.   The server is written in java, with some back-end code coming from extensions/usage of the ZSS in Zowe.    The client code is in Javascript using React.   The tooling is very minimal currently, as is the number of third-party libraries.  *
