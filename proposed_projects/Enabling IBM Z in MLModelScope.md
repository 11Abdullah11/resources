# *Enabling IBM Z in MLModelScope*

## Description
*MLModelScope (https://mlmodelscope.org/)  is a  playground that allows people to try ML tasks with various model types, frameworks and hardware backends. It is jointly developed by IBM and University of Illinois.  It is currently one of the platforms that collaborate with MLPerf for ML benchmark workload validation. (IBM participates in MLPerf as a founding members, including contribution from z).  MLModelScope enables multiple backends for model training, execution and performance study. Currently IBM Z is enabled.

## Desirable Skills
*Perl, Mainframe

## Expected Outcome
*The proposed project targets to enabling IBM Z as an backend in MLModellScope. More specifically, we are looking for developers to work on enabling some hook code on Z so Z can be plugged into MLmodelScope to run ML workload and get instrumentations.  This would allow exposing Z as a valid platform for certain ML tasks such as inference services, attracting more ML practitioners to use Z, and influencing the support of platform compatibility by various frameworks (e.g. endianness issues)*
